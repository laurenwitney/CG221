    <h2>My Favorite Internet 1</h2>

    <h3><a href="http://2016.warp.net/">Warp</a></h3>
    <p>Warp is an interactive website that allows the user to click and drag, similar to panning, to navigate. You can scroll around to see different artists to click on and learn more about them without leaving the webpage. It navigates horizontal, but not vertical. Found through siteinspire.com.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://www.anonymoushamburger.com/">Anonymus Hamburger Society</a></h3>
    <p>Anonymous Hamburger is similar to Warp with the click and drag navigation. It is less static and more fluid than Warp. When you click and drag, it doesn't stop when you unclick. It continues for a second to stop in a more fluid motion. When you click into a recipe, you don't leave the webpage and can easily access the recipes before and after. Found through siteinspire.com.</p>
