    <h2>My Favorite Internet 5</h2>

    <h3>The Scream by Edvard Munch</h3>
    <p>To make this painting interactive on a website, the waves could ripple when your cursor moves over it. When your cursor moves over the face or mouth, it could change expression. </p>

    <h3>The Persistence of Memory by Salvador Dali</h3>
    <p>This piece could be interactive in various ways. When moving the cursor over a clock, it could slide down a bit. You could click and drag the clock hands to change the time. The user could decide where the clocks go by dragging them to different areas of the image.</p>
