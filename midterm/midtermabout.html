<h5>In the Textile Development and Marketing AAS program, I learned about the environmental aspects of textiles. The pesticides used on non-organic cotton have many harmful effects, one of which is that they are harmful to bees. At first this didn't seem like a big deal, but after further reseach, it is. Please read below to learn more!</h5>

      <h3>Why do we need bees?</h3>
      <img src="about1.png" class="bee-info-image" alt="A world without pollinators would be devastating for food production. The ecological service they provide is necessary for the reproduction of over 85% of the world’s flowering plants, including more than 2/3 of the world’s crop species. 70 out of the top 100 human food crops — which supply about 90 percent of the world’s nutrition — are pollinated by bees.">



      <h3>What's the problem?</h3>
      <img src="about2.png" class="bee-info-image" alt="Bee populations are declining at an
alarming rate. Pollination is at risk from pesticide use, habitat loss and introduced diseases. Some insecticides exert negative effects on the health of pollinators. Climate change, such as increasing temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns and more erratic or extreme weather events, have impacts on pollinator populations.">



      <h3>How can I help?</h3>
      <img src="about3.png" class="bee-info-image" alt="Purchase organic rather than conventional food &amp; textiles. Organic products are free of insecticides that are harmful bees.; Plant seeds to grow flowers &amp; crops that bees can pollinate; Be kinder to the planet to decrease the effects of climate change. Suggestions include conserving water &amp; electricity, reducing plastic wate, recycling, and more.">
