      <h2>Save the Bees!</h2>

      <h3>Why do we need bees?</h3>
      <p>A third of all our food depends on their pollination. A world without pollinators would be devastating for food production. The ecological service they provide is necessary for the reproduction of over 85% of the world’s flowering plants, including more than two-thirds of the world’s crop species. Grains are primarily pollinated by the wind, but fruits, nuts and vegetables are pollinated by bees. 70 out of the top 100 human food crops — which supply about 90 percent of the world’s nutrition — are pollinated by bees. Fruits and seeds derived from insect pollination are a major part of the diet of approximately 25% of all birds and mammals ranging from red-backed voles to grizzly bears.</p>



      <h3>What's the problem?</h3>
      <p>Unfortunately, bee populations worldwide are declining at an alarming rate. 44% of bee colonies in the U.S. collapsed in 2016. In many places, the essential service of pollination is at risk from pesticide use, habitat loss and introduced diseases. Some insecticides, at concentrations applied routinely in the current chemical-intensive agriculture system, exert negative effects on the health of pollinators – both individually and at the colony level. The observed, sub-lethal, low-dose effects of insecticides on bees are various and diverse. In addition, climate change, such as increasing temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns and more erratic or extreme weather events, have impacts on pollinator populations.</p>



      <h3>How can I help?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Purchase organic rather than conventional food &amp; textiles. Organic products are free of insecticides that are harmful bees.</li>
        <li>Plant seeds to grow flowers &amp; crops that bees can pollinate</li>
        <li>Be kinder to the planet to decrease the effects of climate change. Suggestions include conserving water &amp; electricity, reducing plastic wate, recycling, and more.</li>
      </ul>
